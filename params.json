Tommasel, C. Mateos, D. Godoy, and A. Zunino. Sparse-matrix arithmetic operations in computer clusters: A text feature selection application. In Proceedings of the 2nd IEEE ARGENCON, pages 458â€“463, June 2014.\r\n\r\n=== Dependencies ===\r\n\r\nSMArtOp depends of two libraries:\r\n\r\n* The Trove library is licensed under the Lesser GNU Public License.\r\n* The JPPF library is licensed under the Apache License V2.0.\r\n\r\n\r\n=== Usage ===\r\n\r\nUsage examples are included in the software distribution in the package test. Two alternative examples of use are provided. First, a stand-alone example in which two matrices are created and then multiplied. Second, an example in which the software is used in the context of a feature selection example. An example of the configuration file needed for executing the feature selection application is provided.\r\n",
