SMArtOp is a Java library for dividing the processing of large-scale sparse-matrix arithmetic operations on distributed environments.The software is designed for dividing and balancing the processing of large-scale sparse-matrix arithmetic operations into simpler and independent tasks to be executed in a distributed environment.

This software was used in:
A. Tommasel, C. Mateos, D. Godoy, and A. Zunino. Sparse-matrix arithmetic operations in computer clusters: A text feature selection application. In Proceedings of the 2nd IEEE ARGENCON, pages 458â€“463, June 2014.

=== Dependencies ===

SMArtOp depends of two libraries:

* The Trove library is licensed under the Lesser GNU Public License.
* The JPPF library is licensed under the Apache License V2.0.


=== Usage ===

Usage examples are included in the software distribution in the package test. Two alternative examples of use are provided. First, a stand-alone example in which two matrices are created and then multiplied. Second, an example in which the software is used in the context of a feature selection example. An example of the configuration file needed for executing the feature selection application is provided.


=== Data ===

The software was tested using the Digg dataset created by Yu-Ru Lin:
Yu-Ru Lin, Jimeng Sun, Paul Castro, Ravi Konuru, Hari Sundaram and Aisling Kelliher, MetaFac: Commmunity Discovery via Relational Hypergraph Factorization, in Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD Conference On Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining (KDD 2009)
