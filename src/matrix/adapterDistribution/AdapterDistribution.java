 * <tt>AdapterDistribution</tt> defines the methods for executing an operation

 * Example of usage:
 * <pre>
 * Matrix res = ...; //creates a matrix in which the result is reconstructed
 * MatrixReconstructionStrategy strategy = ...; //Defines how tasks' results are combined
 * AdapterDistribution adapter = ...;
 * IDataShared dataShared = adapter.getDataShared();
 * 
 * List<ITask> tasks = getTasks(); // returns the task to be executed in the cluster
 * 
 * adapter.createJob(tasks.size(), res, strategy):
 * adapter.addTasks(tasks);
 * adapter.submit();
 * adapter.waitUntilComplete();
 * </pre>
 * After the method {@link #waitUntilComplete()} returns the {@link Matrix} <tt>res</tt> should contain
 * the reconstructed result of executing all tasks.
